# RideCare


This project aims to tackle the issue of rider safety in ride hailing servives like lyft and uber. The main idea behind this project is toxic comment classification and then analyzing the severity associated to these comments and raising an alert accordingly via Twilio. This involves utilizing speech to text and analyzing this text using machine learning models.


## Additonal Information 

This project uses different pre-trained models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classification of the comments.The models used are DistilBERT and RoBERTa. 
## Dataset description 

The dataset used in this project is the hand-labelled 'Toxic Comment Classification' data used to train Google's Perspective API. It is originally a multi-class classification problem with 6 labels - toxic , severe_toxic , obscene, threat , insult and identity hate which has been converted to a single-label binary classification problem using this formula :

**Score = 0.7*P(toxic) + 0.5*P(obscene)+P(threat)+0.8P(insult)+P(identity_hate)+P(severe_toxic)**
